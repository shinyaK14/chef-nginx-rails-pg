# Rails Server Template

## Overview

This is a template chef structure for deploying Rails applications. It's
primarily aimed at projects that want everything running on a single VPS
but don't want to use a SaaS platform such as Heroku.

## Documentation

This is the example code which section one of the book "Reliably Deploying Rails Applications" available from leanpub here <https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications> is based.

If you run into any issues using the template provided here, please open a Github issue, I actively monitor these and will respond as quickly as possible.
